## Required Tasks

### AWS Budgets
I created a new budget to track my credits spend. There was already a budget created in my AWS account to track monthly spend and was set
to $10. This was created during a AWS course I attended for my AWS Developer Associate certification.

The credits tracking budget was set to $1 even though I had no credits but to implement what I learnt and to complete the task given. An alarm was set for me to be notified via email when the forecasted spend is 100% of the budget.
