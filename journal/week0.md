# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture


## Required Tasks

### AWS Billing
From the Billing dashboard, on the billing preference page, I selected options to receive PDF version of my AWS invoice and also to receive 
free tier usage alerts and billing alerts via my email address. Also took a general overview of the billing dashaboard to know how to check cost incurred break down by service and all other billing related options on the dashboard. I also explored cost management on AWS using AWS Cost Explorer, which is a helpful service to get cost and usage reports of resources on your AWS account and alos good for auditing.

### AWS Budgets
I created a new budget to track my credits spend. There was already a budget created in my AWS account to track monthly spend and was set
to $10. This was created during a AWS course I attended for my AWS Developer Associate certification.

The credits tracking budget was set to $1 even though I had no credits but to implement what I learnt and to complete the task given. An alarm was set for me to be notified via email when the forecasted spend is 100% of the budget.
